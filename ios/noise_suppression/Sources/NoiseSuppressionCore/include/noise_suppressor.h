/*
 * Noise suppressor: removes background noise from 10 ms frames of mono voice.
 *
 * This is the whole contract of the package. It knows nothing about WebRTC or
 * any other audio stack: a caller that owns an audio pipeline (a bridge to
 * flutter_webrtc, a recorder) hands frames in and gets them back denoised.
 *
 * Engine: RNNoise v0.1.1 (xiph, BSD-3-Clause). It works on 48 kHz mono only,
 * exactly 480 samples (10 ms) per frame, float samples on the int16 scale
 * (-32768..32767). A frame of any other shape is left unchanged and the call
 * says so, so the caller can fall back to its own processing.
 *
 * Threading. Calls on one suppressor must be serialized by the caller.
 * ns_process never allocates and is meant for the audio thread. ns_create,
 * ns_destroy and ns_reset allocate or free: call them off the audio thread, or
 * where the pipeline already reinitializes (a rate change), never per frame.
 * Different suppressors are independent.
